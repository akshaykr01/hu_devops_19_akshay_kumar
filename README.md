I tried every possible things to do but it is not installed in my machine.
Neither in amazon-linux.

In amazon-linux it is not working sayin docker daemon problem.

So, I installed Ubuntu from microsoft store and successfully configure all the things.
But localhost is not working. I tried many times. BUt it is not.

Sorry! 

In support of my statement I'm giving the screenshots as well.
